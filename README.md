**About**

This is a simple contact form that has not been tested on a server and is to be considered a work in progress.

**Known Issues**

The only issue that I have noticed is the input fields appear to move out of place and the button text also moves. I am not quite sure what is causing that but would appreciate a pull request if fork this repository and fix the issue.

**Permisions**

You may fork this project and restyle or modify it entirely to your own needs but the attributions credited in the files must remain intact. You must also include the LICENSE.

**About Less**

The index.css file was compiled using the less compiler for pre-proccessing. If you just want the animations you can go to my [github repository](https://github.com/ikeman32/animations) to grab them there.
