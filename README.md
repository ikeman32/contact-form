**About**

This is a simple contact form that has not been tested on a server and is to be considered a work in progress.

**Known Issues**

The only issue that I have noticed is the input fields appear to move out of place and the button text also moves. I am not quite sure what is causing that but would appreciate a pull request if fork this repository and fix the issue.
